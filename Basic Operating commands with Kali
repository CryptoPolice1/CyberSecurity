Basic Commands to use:
cd: Change Directory; Moves between folders
mv -v: would output a message confirming the move to the said destination
mv: moves files or directories to a different destination. If a similar folder exists there, it overwrites it.
mv -i: asks before overwriting the file
cat: lists content of the file

To save the output we can use redirection to save the output inside a file :
cat -n example.log example2.log > access_log.log

Use the head command to show the first 10 lines: head access_log.log
Use the tail command to show the last 10 lines: tail access_log.log
Add information to the syslog located in /var/log/syslog by :
logger “any text”

Use the Grep command to filter the output based on one value :
grep -i kali /var/log/syslog

Filter the log file for words containing p,l,c :
grep [plc] access_log.log

Filter the output of the log for lines containing IP addresses:
